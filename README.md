Tech task in GoIT
The project is a React application that displays tweet cards with interactive features such as follow/unfollow functionality, dynamic follower count, and pagination. The tweet cards are fetched asynchronously from an API and can be filtered based on different criteria such as "show all," "follow," or "followings." The application initially displays a fixed number of tweet cards per page and provides a "Load More" button to dynamically load additional tweets. The follower count updates dynamically when the user follows or unfollows a tweet. The application retains the user's actions even after page refresh. The project showcases how to implement interactive tweet cards with filtering, pagination, and asynchronous data fetching in a React application.
